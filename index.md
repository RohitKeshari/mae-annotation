## Introducing MAE
MAE (Multi-document Annotation Environment) is a lightweight, general-purpose natural language annotation tool. 
It was originally created by [Amber Stubbs](http://amberstubbs.net) for use in her dissertation research at Brandeis University, 
and currently [Keigh Rim](https://github.com/keighrim) is maintaining the project.

MAE allows users to define their own annotation tasks, mark up arbitrary text spans, use non-consuming tags, easily create links between annotations, and it outputs annotations in stand-off XML.
It also allows for easy adjudication with visualization of extent tags, link tags, and non-consuming tags from any XML standoff annotated documents. (for best results, the files output by MAE should be used).
While it does not enforce strict rules for annotation schemes, it is very easy to set up and start running. Check out the wiki for the user guide with detailed instructions.

## How to use

### Requirements

Latest MAE requires Java 8 to run (Java 9 or later is recommended for HiDPI machines), and Maven to build. See [the project wiki](https://github.com/keighrim/mae-annotation/wiki) for more details.

For robust Unicode support, MAE uses [DejaVu Sans](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page) font as the default. If the annotation task involves lots of Unicode characters, such as Emojis, users are also recommended to have DejaVu Sans font installed.

### Download and run

Download release package or executable `.jar` from from [releases](https://github.com/keighrim/mae-annotation/releases) page. Once you have `mae-<VERSION>.jar` file, simply double click the file will run MAE. Be sure that you have a proper version of Java installed.

### Annotation and Adjudication

See [the project wiki](https://github.com/keighrim/mae-annotation/wiki) for detailed users' guide.
